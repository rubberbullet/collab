Structure
---------

* Add a single space after each comma delimiter;

* Add a single space around operators (`==`, `&&`, ...);

* Add a blank line before `return` statements, unless the return is alone
  inside a statement-group (like an `if` statement);

* Use braces to indicate control structure body regardless of the number of
  statements it contains;

* Define one class per file - this does not apply to private helper classes
  that are not intended to be instantiated from the outside and thus are not
  concerned by the PSR-0 standard;

* Declare class properties before methods;

* Declare public methods first, then protected ones and finally private ones.

Naming Conventions
++++++++++++++++++

* Use camelCase, not underscores, for variable, function and method
  names, arguments;

* Use underscores for option, parameter names;

* Use namespaces for all classes;

* Suffix interfaces with `Interface`;

* Use alphanumeric characters and underscores for file names;

Documentation
+++++++++++++

* Add PHPDoc blocks for all classes, methods, and functions;

* Omit the `@return` tag if the method does not return anything;

License
+++++++

* SmartyBundle is released under the LGPL-3 license, and the license block has to be present at the top of every PHP file, before the namespace.
